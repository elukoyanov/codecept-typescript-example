      <h2>Welcome to example of app for codecetjs tests with typescript.</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Don't use it as an example of web-development.</b>
        <br />
        Some parts of app have duplications, app has terrific design and its elements are terrible like a web 1.0 pages.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Use this app as an E2E test example only.
        <br />
        It's not the only truth. But it has the right to exist.
        <br />
        Look into folders, see how does files are ordered, how typescript config is set, how tests are placed in one git project with app itself.
        <br />
        And make your own solution.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Good luck.</p>
